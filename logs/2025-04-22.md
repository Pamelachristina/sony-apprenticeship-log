## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [ ] [QSL-1114] Spent today trying to reproduce a bug where a failing scheduled post incorrectly appears as published 
in the console.

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Attempted to hit the POST /dev-test/create-failing-scheduled-post endpoint via Postman.
- [ ] [QSL-1114] Verified the GET endpoint was reachable, but kept getting 400 errors for the POST version.
- [ ] [QSL-1114] Checked port conflicts (8081, 8082, 8084, 9001) and database locks with H2.
- [ ] [QSL-1114] Validated that the controller was wired correctly and the app was running.
