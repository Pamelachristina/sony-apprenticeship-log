## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [ ] [QSL-1114] After a quick huddle with Saumya and watching a few suggested videos on news mngment architecture
    I was able to get a better understanding of what was happening under the hood 
- [ ] [QSL-1114] Looking into the bug where failed scheduled posts still show up as live.
- [ ] [QSL-1114] Found that when publishing fails, the post isn’t marked as FAILED, so it slips through.
- [ ] [QSL-1114] Traced the issue to the PostService.publish(...) method — the error gets caught, but the status isn’t updated.




## 📖 Key Learnings
📌 **New Concepts:**
PostService.publish(...) 
    – What It Does
    This method is responsible for publishing a post, either:

    Immediately (PublishingType.ROUTINE)

    Or via a scheduled job (PublishingType.SCHEDULED)

    It does things like:

    Update post status (e.g., DRAFT → PENDING)

    Call downstream services (like newsService.publish(...))

    Save updates to the DB

    Register or deregister segments (if needed)

🎯 **To-Do for Tomorrow:**

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Plan is to patch the logic, test it locally, and open a PR once it's good.
