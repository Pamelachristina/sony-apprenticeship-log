## ✅ Tasks Completed
🛠 What I worked on:
Investigated the publishScheduledPosts() method inside OfficialNewsApi.java.

Found that exceptions during publish attempts only partially updated statuses.

Added new logic to:

- [ ] [QSL-1114] ✅ Set ScheduledPostEntity.scheduledPublishStatus = FAILED when publishing fails.

- [ ] [QSL-1114] ✅ Set PostEntity.status = FAILED when publishing fails.

- [ ] [QSL-1114] ✅ Save updated post correctly using postService.updateStatus().

Also cleaned up:

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Correct return type of the gRPC method to PublishScheduledPostsResponse, matching the expected proto.

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Fixed import conflicts between protobuf generated types vs model enums (ScheduledPostStatus).

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Made sure no formatting issues with Maven formatter (fmt-maven-plugin).

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Successfully rebuilt the project and started the gRPC server on port 50051.

## 🔜 Next Steps & Goals
🎯 **To-Do for Tomorrow:**
- [ ] [QSL-1114]  Simulated a publishing failure (locally using forced exceptions).

Verified that after failure:

- [ ] [QSL-1114]  PostEntity.status = FAILED

- [ ] [QSL-1114]  ScheduledPostEntity.scheduledPublishStatus = FAILED

- [ ] [QSL-1114]  Confirmed database updates were correct.

C- [ ] [QSL-1114]  Confirmed no wrong "Published" posts are left behind after failure.

📅 **Long-Term Goals:**
-

## 🔗 Useful Resources & Notes
-🛠 What was broken originally:
Scheduled posts that failed to publish in the backend (Kamaji) were still showing as Published in the frontend (E1).

Root cause: Kamaji updated only ScheduledPostEntity.scheduledPublishStatus to FAILED, but did not update PostEntity.status.

Because of this, the E1 frontend (which relies mostly on PostEntity.status) incorrectly showed failed posts as Published.
