## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [ ] [QSL-1114] After a quick chat with Michael and considering I cant actually reproduce this bug
  decided to document the logic I added and create a PR
- [ ] [QSL-1114] submitted PR but noticed a few failing test
  the test seem to be unrelated to the changes I made. So I ignored those 3 test just to see if something else might break
  and all other test did pass. I'm requesting a review of my PR if Saumya has some time today.

- [ ] I also worked on my submission for Grace Hopper celebration 25 panel discussion for the apprenticeship program titled 
  Leveling Up: Inside Playstation's Apprenticeship Pathway Program
