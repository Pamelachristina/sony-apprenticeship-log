## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [ ] [QSL-1114] Recreated the bug exactly with test ID 9999

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Verified that FAILED status still left a story live

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Found that the bug happens when the story is published, but an error after that causes us to mark it FAILED

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Learned that the bug is in the logic, not infrastructure

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Identified that we need to unpublish before marking as failed

- [ ] [QSL-1114] Took a huge step toward solving it 🎯



## 📖 Key Learnings
📌 **New Concepts:**
🔍 What I Learned from Investigating the Scheduler
- The scheduler is the component actually triggering the bug — it runs every 30 minutes and calls publishScheduledPosts().

- Inside publishScheduledPosts():

    Each scheduled post is attempted via postService.publish(...)

    If an exception is thrown, the post is marked as FAILED

    ❗️However, there is no check for whether the post was already published to NewsPublisher before the exception happened

That explains the core of the bug:
✅ DB status: FAILED
❌ But story is still live on E1 — because the publish succeeded before the error

This matches exactly what we were seeing in the real-world bug report.
