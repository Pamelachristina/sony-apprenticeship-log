## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [ ] Investigated how the vop-new-post-btn-dropdown dropdown is controlled in the codebase.
- [ ] Checked inline scripts and linked JavaScript files for any references to the dropdown elements.
- [ ] Used DevTools to track event listeners and attribute modifications on the dropdown.
- [ ] Verified if jQuery is being used and searched for relevant .dropdown() or onClick handlers.

## 📖 Key Learnings
📌 **New Concepts:**
- Understanding how dropdown menus are dynamically managed via JavaScript.
- Using DevTools to track event listeners and attribute modifications.
- Searching project files efficiently to locate JavaScript logic controlling elements.


🛠 **New Tools & Tech:**
- Chrome DevTools (Breakpoints, Event Listeners, Console Debugging).


## ⚠️ Challenges & Roadblocks
❌ **Issues Faced:**
- Unable to immediately locate where the dropdown is being controlled in the JavaScript files.
- Not sure if the dropdown logic is handled via Bootstrap, jQuery, or custom JavaScript.
- Dependency on team members for insights into older implementations.


🔍 **How I Plan to Solve It:**
- Continue searching for event handlers by tracing DOM modifications in DevTools.
- Run $('.dropdown-menu').data() in the DevTools Console to check if Bootstrap is managing it.
- Ask the team if there are specific files/modules where dropdown logic is usually handled.

## 🔜 Next Steps & Goals
🎯 **To-Do for Tomorrow:**
- [ ] Identify and test modifications to dropdown logic once the JavaScript file is found.
- [ ] Ensure that any changes don’t break existing behavior.
- [ ] Document findings so the team has better visibility into the dropdown’s behavior.

📅 **Long-Term Goals:**
- Improve debugging skills by efficiently tracing JavaScript events.
- Gain deeper understanding of how UI components are structured in the codebase.
- Potentially refactor or improve dropdown handling if needed.
