## ✅ Tasks Completed
-[ ] [QSL-1707] resolved a bunch of merge conflicts 
requesting another PR review from Saumya or Chun if either of you have some availability

-[ ] [QSL-1787] made some progress with IT help desk on getting API Key for Open AI. I need to get my project reviewed
- waiting on reply

- [ ] [QSL 1114] Spent more time setting up the frontend (iptools-official-news) to point to my local backend
  (kamaji-official-news) so I can dig into the post publishing bug.
- Updated the iptools-official-news frontend to use .env.local and point to the backend
- Running into an issue where the frontend is still trying to hit /info directly instead
  of using the configured REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL value
- Confirmed the .env.local file is set, but the frontend isn’t picking it up — currently
  troubleshooting whether it’s a dev server caching issue or env loading issue
