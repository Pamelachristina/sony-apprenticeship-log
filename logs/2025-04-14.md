## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [ ] [QSL 1114] Spent more time setting up the frontend (iptools-official-news) to point to my local backend 
(kamaji-official-news) so I can dig into the post publishing bug.
- Updated the iptools-official-news frontend to use .env.local and point to the backend
- Running into an issue where the frontend is still trying to hit /info directly instead 
of using the configured REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL value
- Confirmed the .env.local file is set, but the frontend isn’t picking it up — currently 
troubleshooting whether it’s a dev server caching issue or env loading issue

-[ ] [QSL-1787] currently chatting with IT help desk on how to get API Key for Open AI
-[ ] [QSL-1707] requesting another PR review from Saumya or Chun if either of you have some availability
